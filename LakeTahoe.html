<p>Lake Tahoe is a large freshwater lake in the Sierra Nevada of the United States. At a surface elevation of 6,225 ft, it is located along the border between California and Nevada, west of Carson City. With crystal, clear blue water, sandy beaches, boats, beers and babes what's not to love? Lake Tahoe is hands down my favorite place in the world. Year around you can be outside in nature doing a number of different activities. Catch me on the slopes in the winter or lake side in the summer!</p>
